          In the previous part of the study, you tried an online voting system. In this part of the study, we kindly ask you to update your cast vote in the voting system. Before proceeding, we ask for you consent.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">Description of research</h3>
        <p>
          Before entering the voting system, you will be asked to download an
          instruction paper for the voting system. After entering the system,
          you are asked to test the voting system by following the instruction
          paper. This will be followed by a questionnaire, which you will get
          redirected to from the last page of the voting system. Once you have
          completed the questionnaire, you will be redirected to Prolific. The
          total duration of the study is approximately X minutes. We highly
          recommend using a desktop device for the study.
        </p>
        <h3>Withdrawal</h3>
        <p>
          You can withdraw your consent about being part of the study at any
          time before the completion of the study, meaning before you submit the
          survey. In this case your collected data will be deleted by the
          researchers. For more information on how to withdraw from a study
          before completion in Prolific, see this link:{" "}

          </a>
          After completing the study, you may still request to have your data deleted until 14 days after submitting the survey by contacting the researhers and provide your Prolific ID, which allows us to locate and remove your data. After this deadline, it will no longer be possible to delete your data.
        </p>
          <h3 className="title-margin-top">Ethical Considerations and Your Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>
          The voting system you are testing is designed to help prevent coercion in online voting. In the following survey, you may be asked questions such as "Imagine you are coerced, what do you do?" These questions are intended to understand how users might respond to coercion scenarios and to improve the security of online voting. If you feel any discomfort or distress from these questions or the study in general, you may leave the study at any time without penalty.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">Compensation</h3>
        <p>
          Each participant will receive X £ at the conclusion of the study
          through Prolific.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">How we handle and delete the data</h3>
        <p>
          If a participant discloses any personal information about themselves
          or other people in the voting system or when answering the
          questionnaire that could lead to identification, the researchers will remove this from the dataset and
          replace it with a placeholder.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">What data we collect</h3>
        <p>
          The participants will be asked to share the following personal data:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-margin-top">
          <li>Gender</li>
          <li>Age</li>
          <li>Nationality</li>
          <li>Level of education</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-margin-top">
          We further collect the answers that the participants give to the
          questions in the questionnaire, as well as data that the participants are asked to provide within
          the voting system. Please note that all candidates on the digital
          voting paper are fictional and the participants are asked to vote for
          a specific candidate before they enter the voting system. Therefore,
          we do not collect any sensitive personal data on political interests.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">How we use the data</h3>
        <p>
          We collect and process your data for research purposes under the public interest legal basis. 
          These data will be used to derive statistical measures of users'
          attitudes towards internet voting systems, as well as qualitative insights from open-ended responses.. The data might be
          referenced or quoted, but not printed in full unless it is completely
          anonymized, in the published research reports and other academic
          publications.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title-margin-top">Who has access to the data?</h3>
        <p>
          The researchers have access to the original data until it has been
          edited to replace given personal information with placeholders as to
          anonymize it.
        </p>
