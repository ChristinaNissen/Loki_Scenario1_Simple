              To vote online, log in to the voting platform and follow the on-screen instructions. The process consists of the following steps:

            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">

              </li>
              <li>
                Cast your vote by choosing your candidate and submitting your ballot.

              <li className="space-y-2">
  <span>
    After submitting your ballot, a confirmation screen will display a card linked to your submitted ballot. The card is shown only during this session and will not be shown again after you leave the voting system.

              Each time you revote, the system will ask you to identify your previous vote(s) using the card(s) you saw when voting earlier. This includes all previous voting attempts, even if a vote was later replaced.

              You need to identify your previous vote(s) to ensure the security and integrity of the revoting process. This helps the system both confirm your identity and protect your vote from potential coercion:

              <li>
                <strong>Anti-coercion protection:</strong> This allows you to invalidate a coerced vote without others knowing, either by intentionally selecting the wrong cards when identifying previous votes or by answering the question about whether you have voted before in a way that does not reveal your true voting history.

              Voter coercion happens when someone pressures or forces you to vote in a particular way against your will. This can take several forms:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Direct threats:</strong> Someone threatens harm if you do not vote as they demand.</li>
              <li><strong>Intimidation:</strong> Creating fear or discomfort to influence your vote.</li>
              <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Someone watching over your shoulder while you vote.</li>
              <li><strong>Family pressure:</strong> Relatives insisting that you vote according to family preferences.</li>
              <li><strong>Financial leverage:</strong> Promises of rewards or threats of financial consequences based on how you vote.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Online voting is particularly vulnerable to coercion because it occurs outside the privacy of an official voting booth. The anti-coercion measures in this system are designed to help you protect your true voting intentions, even under pressure.

              <li>
                <strong>Answer or select incorrectly:</strong> You can protect yourself by intentionally answering the question about whether you have voted before incorrectly, or by selecting the wrong card(s) when asked to identify previous votes. This will cause the coerced vote to be invalid.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vote again later:</strong> You may comply under pressure and cast a vote as instructed, then vote again later in private. If you correctly identify your previous votes when revoting, your new vote will be valid and replace the coerced one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vote in person:</strong> You can choose to vote at a physical polling station, where privacy is guaranteed. Physical votes are final and always take precedence over online votes.

            Your voting privacy is protected through several system-level measures:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">

              Votes are encrypted before being sent over the network, preventing

            </li>
            <li>
              Your ballot is mixed with decoy votes in the database. This ensures
              that even in the event of a breach, your vote cannot be traced back to you.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Keep in mind that privacy cannot be guaranteed if someone is physically
            watching your screen or if your device is compromised by malware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always vote in a private, secure environment and ensure your device
            has the latest security updates. If you are unsure, you can vote in person
            at your local polling station.
